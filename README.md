# js-sorting-algos

## Purpose

Just implementing various sorting algorithms in Javascript. Will use as a base for teaching folks/helping folks learn about sorting implementations in JS. 

## Installation

Only dependency is `mocha` for running tests. 
`npm i` should install it if you don't have it installed globally.

## TODO

* Finish the other sorting implementations
* Properly expose each sort externally?
* Finish writing tests for all the implementations
* Error handling (if any needed)
* Add npm commands that display Big O details for each sort in help script
